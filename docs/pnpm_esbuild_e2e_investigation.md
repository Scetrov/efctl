# PNPM ESBuild E2E Fix Hunt

## PROBLEM
CI e2e test die. `pnpm install` fail inside container. Error:
```
[ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS] Ignored build scripts: esbuild@0.27.2
Run "pnpm approve-builds" to pick which dependencies should be allowed to run scripts.
Deployment failed: failed to deploy world: exec error: exit status 1
```

## ROOT CAUSE
pnpm 10+ got picky. Block build scripts by default. `esbuild` need native binding compile. `onlyBuiltDependencies=esbuild` in `.npmrc` not work right. `pnpm approve-builds esbuild` say "no packages awaiting approval" — pnpm think already approved or config wrong.

## STEPS TRIED

### Step 1: .npmrc patch (commit c5963f2)
Add `onlyBuiltDependencies=esbuild` to `.npmrc` in `world-contracts` and `builder-scaffold`.
Also add `"onlyBuiltDependencies": ["esbuild"]` to `package.json` pnpm block.
**Result:** CI still fail. pnpm 10 still block esbuild build scripts.

### Step 2: pnpm approve-builds (commit e4ea805)
Change `CmdDeployWorld` to:
```
pnpm approve-builds esbuild && pnpm install && pnpm deploy-world
```
**Result:** CI still fail. Log show "There are no packages awaiting approval" — pnpm not work right. Config in `.npmrc` and `package.json` not enough for pnpm 10.

### Step 3: pnpm install || true
Try skip error with `|| true`.
**Result:** Bad idea. esbuild native binding not build. `pnpm deploy-world` still fail — need esbuild binary.

### Step 4: Copilot review fixes (commit 8cf75b5)
- Fix CRLF handling in `patchNpmrc` — trim `\r` too
- Fix wrong `#nosec G304` (should be `G306` for write)
- Fix test error handling in `TestPatchPackageJSON`, `TestPatchNpmrc_Idempotent`
**Result:** Unit test pass. gosec clean. But e2e still die.

## WHAT WE KNOW
1. Container run `pnpm install` — esbuild build script block by pnpm 10
2. `.npmrc` with `onlyBuiltDependencies=esbuild` not work as expected
3. `package.json` pnpm block not work either
4. `pnpm approve-builds esbuild` not work — pnpm say nothing to approve
5. esbuild native binding MUST compile for `pnpm deploy-world` to work
6. `pnpm install || true` bad — esbuild not build, deploy fail later
7. Docker image has pnpm 10+ with corepack
8. Node.js v20.20.2 in container (warn about version drift)

## INVESTIGATION PROMPT FOR NEXT AGENT

```
Hey agent. Help me fix pnpm esbuild e2e fail. Here is what we try already.

Context:
- efctl env up build Docker image from builder-scaffold/Dockerfile
- Container run pnpm install then pnpm deploy-world inside world-contracts
- pnpm 10+ block esbuild build scripts by default
- .npmrc onlyBuiltDependencies config not work for pnpm 10
- pnpm approve-builds not work (say nothing to approve)

Files to check:
- pkg/setup/constants.go (CmdDeployWorld line)
- pkg/setup/pnpm_patch.go (patchNpmrc, patchPackageJSON)
- pkg/setup/start.go (StartEnvironment calls patchPnpmDependencies)
- pkg/container/services.go (FrontendConfig has its own pnpm install)
- world-contracts/Dockerfile (from upstream clone, what pnpm version?)
- builder-scaffold/Dockerfile (from upstream clone)

Questions to answer:
1. What pnpm version in container? Check Dockerfile FROM image.
2. Does pnpm 10 support onlyBuiltDependencies in .npmrc? Or need .npmrcrc?
3. Can we add esbuild install step in Dockerfile instead of at runtime?
4. Should we use npm or yarn instead? (probably not — pnpm is standard)
5. Can we set pnpm config via ENV or CLI flag? --config.onlyBuiltDependencies?
6. Is there a .npmrcrc or pnpm config file we should patch instead?
7. Does the FrontendConfig pnpm install also fail? Check line 115 services.go

Suggested approaches to evaluate:
A. Patch Dockerfile to run `pnpm add -g esbuild` or similar at build time
B. Use pnpm CLI flag: `pnpm install --config.onlyBuiltDependencies='["esbuild"]'`
C. Create .npmrcrc file with esbuild config (pnpm 10 behavior?)
D. Patch entrypoint.sh to run approve-builds before deploy
E. Use --ignore-scripts flag but pre-build esbuild binary separately
F. Check if pnpm version in container supports the config differently

Pre-conditions (must have):
- All unit test pass: `go test -v ./pkg/setup/...`
- gosec clean: `gosec -quiet ./pkg/setup/...`
- govulncheck clean: `govulncheck ./...`
- e2e test pass locally (if Docker available): `go test -tags e2e -timeout 15m ./tests/e2e/...`
- e2e test pass in CI

Post-conditions (must achieve):
- CI e2e-tests check turn green
- pnpm install complete without ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS error
- esbuild native binding compile successful
- pnpm deploy-world execute without fail
- No breaking change to existing behavior
- .npmrc and package.json patches remain idempotent

Output:
- Analysis of root cause
- Recommended fix approach with justification
- Implementation plan (files to change, what to change)
- Verification steps
```

## CURRENT STATE
- Branch: `chore/bump-codeql-and-crypto`
- Last commit: `8cf75b5` — Copilot fixes (CRLF, #nosec, test errors)
- `CmdDeployWorld` currently: `pnpm install --prefer-offline && pnpm deploy-world`
- CI status: e2e-tests FAILING, all other checks PASSING
- Unit tests: PASSING
- gosec: PASSING

## NOTES
- Copilot 4 review comments fixed
- CRLF fix good for cross-platform
- #nosec G304→G306 fix correct
- Test error handling fixes good
- Nothing about pnpm/esbuild yet
